## Abstract

`ruse` will be a pragmatic language and a standard library for the
browser.

`ruse` will integrate well with JavaScript ecosystem in the sense that
it will be easy to use existing JavaScript libraries. Eventually, it
will support [R7RS](http://r7rs.org/) and all its libraries.

`ruse` wants to be a *good enough* framework for building frontend web
applications.

## Rationale

> "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."
>
> *Confucius*

The project was started because there is (was?) not existing Scheme
implementation that supported tail-call-optimization in the browser
that is (was?) actually working.

`ruse` is not only a learning project about Scheme programming
language but also an exercices about compilers.
